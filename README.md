# Roomify

Roomify is a cross-platform web and mobile application that helps users discover, save, and personalize home design ideas. After signing up and completing a quick style questionnaire, users can explore a curated, Pinterest-style feed of rooms, filter by categories like kitchen or bedroom, and save favorites to their profile. The app also includes interactive features like uploading personal room photos, generating AI-powered redesign suggestions based on style preferences, and linking to real products through clickable images.
